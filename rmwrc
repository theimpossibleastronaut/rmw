WASTE = $HOME/.trash.rmw

# If you would like this to be your primary trash folder (which usually means
# that it will be the same as your Desktop Trash folder) be sure it precedes
# any other WASTE folders listed in the config file
#
# If you want it checked for files that need purging, simply uncomment
# The line below. Files you move with rmw will go to the folder above by
# default.

# Removable media: If a folder has ',removable' appended to it, rmw
# will not try to create it; it must be initially created manually. If
# the folder exists when rmw is run, it will be used; if not, it will be
# skipped. Once you create "example_waste", rmw will automatically create
# example_waste/info and example_waste/files
#
#WASTE=/mnt/sda10000/example_waste, removable

# purge will not run unless `--force` is used at the command line. Uncomment
# the line below if you would like purge to check daily for files that
