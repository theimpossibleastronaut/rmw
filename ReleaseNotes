=== RMW Release Notes ===

  * Feature removed: restore with '-z' using only the basename from any
  directory. User must be in a Trash directory or specify the full path
  (e.g. rmw -z ~/.local/share/Trash/foo.bar). For details, see issue
  #272.

  * Fixed broken purge test

  * Fix for compiling with gcc 10 (Thanks to muralikodali and GazL)

  * Added '-R' option, changed '--recurse' option to '--recursive',
  added recursive (rm compatibility) options in --help output, fixed
  message shown when using '-r, --recursive'
