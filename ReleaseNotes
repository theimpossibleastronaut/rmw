=== RMW Release Notes ===

v0.7.04

  * To get user's home dir, revert back to retrieving via environmental
  variable (conforms to FreeDesktop Trash Spec)

  * The config file is now read from $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rmwrc or
  ~/.config/rmwrc.

  * `lastpurge` is now 'purge-time' and stored in $XDG_DATA_HOME/rmw or
  ~/.local/share/rmw.

  * `lastrmw` is now 'mrl' and stored in $XDG_DATA_HOME/rmw or
  ~/.local/share/rmw.

  * The default Waste folder (specified in the configuration file) is now
  ~/.local/share/Waste instead of ~/trash.rmw.

  * The ~/.config/rmw directory is no longer used. It can be deleted,
  but you may first want to copy your old configuration file to the new
  location.
