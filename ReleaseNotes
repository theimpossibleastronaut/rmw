=== RMW Release Notes ===

v0.9.1

  * bugfix: In some cases, trashinfo file doesn't get removed (#400)
  * tests: build or rebuild binary before running script-based tests (fix for

  directory)

  find the ncurses menu library
  * fix build on Alpine Linux (check for and link to musl-fts) Thanks to
