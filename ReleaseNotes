=== RMW Release Notes ===

v0.7.07

  * bugfix: When restoring files from removable media or devices, rmw
  will now process relative paths (this primarily affects users who
  trash a file with the "move to trash" option from their desktop, and
  then later try to restore with rmw. See
  https://github.com/theimpossibleastronaut/rmw/issues/299 for more
  information).

  * bugfix: list output (rmw -lv) shows all removable devices as
  attached even for those that are detached.

  * Removed deprecated config option (purgeDays)

  * Minor updates to tests infrastructure

  * (for testing) Replace RMWTRASH(=fake-year) with RMW_FAKE_YEAR(=true)

Note to mac os users: Purging tests are failing on the Travis CI test
system when using xcode 11.5 and above. If you get errors while purging
or 'make check' fails for you, please report on issue
