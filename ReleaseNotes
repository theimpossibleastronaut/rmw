=== RMW Release Notes ===

v0.8.1

  * the curses menu library is now much more likely to be found on *BSD
  systems

  * bugfix: when attempting to restore a file from a waste folder
  listed in the config file that has a trailing slash, rmw will no
  longer report that the file is not in a waste folder.

  - curses is no longer a requirement (configure -Dwithout-curses=true)

  - removed '-e' command line option ('--empty' option not affected)
