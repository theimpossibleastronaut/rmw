Please see [contributors](https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/graphs/contributors) to

Bugfix: Errors displayed while creating necessary directories, which
would happen if only one WASTE folder was listed in the config file.

A Portuguese (pt_PT) translation has been added.

If you would like to add a translation, please see [the Translating wiki page](https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/wiki/Translating)
for information and instructions.

The last major release of rmw was v0.4.01, which was released on

information about many other notable changes and improvements to rmw.

We are now using Slack for the [rmw chat room](https://join.slack.com/t/removetowaste/shared_invite/enQtMjU3NTA0NTI2OTgzLTkzMzQxNDhjYzlkM2UxMTA2MzJjNWYyZjAyYzkyNWNmZjJmYWZmYjUyODk2NzNkNzBhMzFjOGZkMTg2MzAxMTM).

rmw 0.4.01 has been released

Please see the
[contributors](https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/graphs/contributors) file to
see a list of the people who have helped shape this release.

Martijn de Boer has done some testing and found that rmw will build and run on
Linux, Mac OS X, and *BSD. He also reports that it builds and runs on Windows
using [WSL](https://github.com/ethanhs/WSL-Programs). We'd like rmw to have
the ability to run natively on Windows and if anyone is interested in helping
with that, please subscribe to the
[ticket](https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/issues/71), or leave a comment.

The --select feature now displays a list that can be scrolled through, and
file sizes are now shown next to each file.

libncurses(5 or 6)-dev is now required to build (used for the --select
feature)

Support for translating output messages using
[gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) has been added. rmw has been
translated into the following languages:
    * Dutch
    * Finnish
    * Nepali
    * Polish

If you would like to add a translation, please see [the Translating wiki
page](https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/wiki/Translating) for information and
instructions.

man pages are now available in the following languages:

    * de
    * en
    * es
    * fi
    * ne
    * nl_NL
    * pl
    * pt_BR

-t --translate option added. This option will display a
translation of the config file in your native language. Unfortunately, as
mentioned above, only 4 languages are supported at present.

-ff option added. Using extra force at runtime (-ff) will now prevent messages
such as "Directory not purged - still contains files" when purging directories
that contain non-writable subdirectories.

A new feature for testing has been added. Temporarily setting the RMWTRASH
environmental variable at run-time to "fake-year" will write the year 1999 to
the DeletionDate string in the .trashinfo file when removed with rmw.

    Ex: `RMWTRASH=fake-year rmw some.txt temp.asc files.doc`

Then run rmw with the purge option: `rmw -fg` and those three files would be
removed.

If purge_after is > 0, rmw will only  show the message "purge has been
skipped: use -f or --force" once a day, regardless of verbosity level. This
improves the behavior where that message would display every time if --force
wasn't used (or if "force_not_required" was used in the config file).

-o, --orphaned option added This will create a .trashinfo file if the
corresponding .trashinfo is not found (missing trashinfo files were a problem
in the early days of testing. If it happens now, it would be because of a bug
that has yet to be discovered).

The -p, --pause option has been removed

The undo_file (lastrmw) is now removed after when -u is used.

We are now using Slack for the [rmw chat
room](https://join.slack.com/t/removetowaste/shared_invite/enQtMjU3NTA0NTI2OTgzLTkzMzQxNDhjYzlkM2UxMTA2MzJjNWYyZjAyYzkyNWNmZjJmYWZmYjUyODk2NzNkNzBhMzFjOGZkMTg2MzAxMTM).

2016-09-18

Two new developers have contributed patches to rmw: Parth Suresh and
Bruce Hernandez.

Notable changes from the previous release:

We believe the 'missing aclocal' error received when building is fixed.

When files are ReMoved or purged, each one will not not display unless
--verbose -v is used at the command line; instead, a summary line will
show how many files were ReMoved or purged.

For purge to run, -f --force is needed as an argument at the command line.
If 'force_not_required' is added to your config file, then using the extra
argument is not needed.

Restoring a file with the 'select' option will no longer fail.

Adding ',removable' after a WASTE folder in your config file will mean
that rmw won't try to create that directory; it must be manually created
prior to first use. If the WASTE folder is present, rmw will use it, if not
rmw will skip over it.

symlinks: rmw can now find the info file when restoring them.

Files can be restored using only the basename, from within any directory.
NOTE: That feature will not process wildcards unless the user is in a
<WASTE>/files folder and the filespec actually exists in the present
working directory.

.trashinfo files now conform to the freedesktop Trash specification
(e.g. if the Path= key in a .trashinfo contains '%20' as part of the filename,
it will be converted to a 'space' when it is restored).
See https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/issues/20 for more detail.

2016-09-04

This release includes a fix for issue #24.

Notable changes since v2016.09.04.01a:

Improvements to directory protection feature (See README)

Added function to create directories when parents don't exist (sometimes
creating a WASTE directory would fail).

Added '-Wall' option to the Makefile, and then fixed the warnings
(issue #17)

Thanks to Jammy, I fixed the warning about missing automake 1.14 (issue #21)

Added more error checking for things that rarely go wrong.

Updated documentation; information for first-time users can be viewed
with 'rmw --help'.

The home page for RMW is now at https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/wiki

I've optimized the code some but there is a lot more to do. If you
are interested in contributing and getting credit for your work, please
contact me via the methods listed in the README.

Anyone wishing to get notified of new releases may sign up for the
mailing list on SourceForge:

I still haven't decided what to use for a primary web site.


-- August 6, 2016 --

The potential mangling of the trash directory string when using "$HOME"
in the config file is now fixed!
https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/issues/2

-- August 5, 2016 --
-Version 2016.08.05.01a-

I'm not seeing a problem anymore with the trash directory string
getting mangled.

This is a minor update to the last release from 2013. Besides the bug-fix,
I've been working at cleaning up the code, and plan to continue.
