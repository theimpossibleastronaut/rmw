=== RMW Release Notes ===

2016-09-04

This release includes a fix for issue #24.

Notable changes since v2016.09.04.01a:

Improvements to directory protection feature (See README)

Added function to create directories when parents don't exist (sometimes
creating a WASTE directory would fail).

Added '-Wall' option to the Makefile, and then fixed the warnings
(issue #17)

Thanks to Jammy, I fixed the warning about missing automake 1.14 (issue #21)

Added more error checking for things that rarely go wrong.

Updated documentation; information for first-time users can be viewed
with 'rmw --help'.

I've optimized the code some but there is a lot more to do. If you

I still haven't decided what to use for a primary web site.

The potential mangling of the trash directory string when using "$HOME"
in the config file is now fixed!

-Version 2016.08.05.01a-

I'm not seeing a problem anymore with the trash directory string
getting mangled.

This is a minor update to the last release from 2013. Besides the bug-fix,
I've been working at cleaning up the code, and plan to continue.
