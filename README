rmw (ReMove to Waste) functions as a command line recycle bin/trash can
utility. Optionally, it can ReMove files to Desktop trash, restore files,
list files to be selected for restore, and purge (permanently delete)
files that were trashed x number of days ago.

This is the README for the development version of rmw. It may mention
features that aren't included in the last release, or differ in other ways.
The README from the last release is at
https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/blob/master/README

After rmw is installed, create the user configuration directory by typing
'rmw' and hitting enter. Afterward, it's recommended to copy /etc/rmwrc (or
/usr/local/etc/rmwrc) to $HOME/.config/rmw and then rename it to 'config':

'cd ~/.config/rmw'
'~/.config/rmw$ cp /etc/rmwrc .'
'~/.config/rmw$ mv rmwrc config'

Then edit the file to suit your needs.

At some point, rmw will automatically create a 'lastpurge' and 'lastrmw'
in that same directory.

== Configuration File ==

Documentation explaining the configuration can be found in 'rmwrc', and
extra examples in 'rmwrc_config_example'.

Waste folders will be created automatically. (e.g. if '$HOME/trash.rmw'
is listed in the config file, these 3 directories will be created:
$HOME/trash.rmw
$HOME/trash.rmw/files
$HOME/trash.rmw/info

== Purging ==

If purging is 'on', rmw will permanently delete files from the folders
specified in the configuration file after 'x' number of days. Purging
can be disabled by using 'purgeDays = 0' in configuration file. rmw will
only check once per day if it's time to purge. Use -g to force a check.
The day of the last purge is stored in $HOME/config/rmw/lastpurge

== Options ==:

-c, --config filename     use an alternate configuration
-l, --list                list waste directories
-p, --pause               wait for a keypress before exiting
-g, --purge               run purge even if it's been run today
-z, --restore <wildcard filename(s) pattern>
-s, --select              select files from list to restore
-u, --undo-last           undo last ReMove
-B, --bypass              bypass directory protection
-v, --verbose             increase output messages
-w, --warranty            display warranty
-V, --version             display version and license information

== -z option ==

While -z can restore files at the command line, you have to specify
the full path (wildcards ok).
Example: rmw -z ~/.trash.rmw/files/*.iso

The other way is be in the WASTE/files/ folder; then using only
the basename will work.

== Protected directories ==

explained:
if 'PROTECT = /home/andy' is specified in the config file, /home/andy, and
all dirs and files beneath it will be "protected". This warning will show
up:

"File is in protected directory: <filename/dir>"

And it will not get rmw'ed

WASTE folders and the rmw configuration/data directory are protected by
default (there is no need to add a 'PROTECT =' line for them.
