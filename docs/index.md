rmw (ReMove to Waste) is a safe-remove utility for the command line.
Its goal is to conform to [the FreeDesktop.org Trash
specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/trash-spec/trashspec-latest.html)
and therefore be compatible with KDE, GNOME, Xfce, and others. Desktop
integration is optional however, and by default, rmw will only use a
waste folder separated from your desktop trash. One of its unique
features is the ability to purge items from your Waste/Trash
directories after x number of days.

rmw is written in C, open source, and has a [GNU
GPLv3 License](https://github.com/theimpossibleastronaut/rmw/blob/master/COPYING).
