The files in the directory are not meant to be viewed with an editor;
they are used by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to generate the rmw website at
https://remove-to-waste.info/

If you would like to view the website offline and already have jekyll
installed, in the docs/ directory, run

    bundle exec jekyll serve

and in your web browser, navigate to http://localhost:4000/

Information for contributors about working on the website can be found
at https://remove-to-waste.info/website-design.html
