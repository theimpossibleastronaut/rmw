.TH RMW "1" "June 2020"
.SH NAME
rmw - remove files, safely
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrmw\fR \fI[OPTION]\fR... FILE...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrmw\fR is a safe-delete utility that sends files to your "Desktop"
trash (or a completely separate folder). It can also restore files and permanently
delete files that were rmw'ed more than a certain (configurable) number of days ago.
.SH RESTORING FILES
There are different ways to restore a file, or multiple files.

Use the -s option to show a list of files that can be restored.

Use the -u option to restore the file(s) that were last removed by rmw.

Use the \fB\-z\fR (or \fB\-\-restore\fR) option
and specify the path to them in in the \fI<WASTE>/files\fR folder (wildcards ok).
e.g. '\fBrmw \-z ~/.local/share/Waste/files/foo*\fR'.
.SH PURGING
If purging is 'on', \fBrmw\fR will permanently delete files from the folders
specified in the configuration file after 'x' number of days.
Purging can be disabled by using '\fBpurge_after = 0\fR' in configuration file.
\fBrmw\fR will only check once per day if it's time to purge (use \fB\-g\fR to check more often).
Add the line '\fBforce_required\fR' in your \fBrmw\fR configuration
file to require \fB\-f\fR (\fB\-\-force\fR) to enable purge.
