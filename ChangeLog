rmw ChangeLog

2018-12-12

  * When Restore() is called from main(), rmw will leave a return
  code equal to the number of errors returned by Restore() (if any).

2018-12-08

  * Implemented unit testing (though I've only created one unit test and
  no docs for unit testing yet)

2018-12-05

  * release version 0.7.01

2018-12-02

* Added --enable-debug option to `configure`.

2018-11-28

* Bugfix: "In some cases, not all files are displayed when using '-s'"
  <https://github.com/theimpossibleastronaut/rmw/issues/205>
  Enabled "wide-character" support by linking against ncursesw and
  menuw (instead of curses and menu). Some users may need to install
  libcursesw5-dev (or similarly named package) for the build to work.
  Thanks to Norm for giving me the solution.


2018-11-16

* Bugfix: On OpenBSD rmw would segfault 80% of the time.
https://github.com/theimpossibleastronaut/rmw/commit/7117c4f7761b7a5ba670e48260d0fcddb3908c35

Thanks to GazL for pointing the problem out to me.

2018-11-11

* rmw will warn the user about invalid or unknown options if it finds any
  in the config file (instead of just ignoring it).

2018-11-06

* If there is no default configuration file present, one will be
  written to $HOME/.config/rmw/config when rmw is first run.

* If verbosity is on, rmw will tell the user which config file is being used

2018-11-04

* When running purge, rmw will now show the total number of files and
  directories deleted, as well as the amount of bytes that were freed.

2018-10-30

* `rmw -s` now returns a sorted list of files

2018-10-26

* PROTECT feature removed

2018-10-24

* released rmw v0.4.05

2018-10-22

* tests for the Restore feature have been added.
* The configuration file (rmwrc) is no longer installed when `make
  install` is run.

2018-10-21

* test scripts are now run using 'make test-...' from the test directory

2018-10-11

* fr_FR translation added


2018-10-02

2018-01-07

    Added test script (test/purging.sh)

2018-01-03

2017-12-27

    rmw-0.4.03 released

2017-12-26

    [#140] Bugfix: rmw will now create the files/ and info/ directories
    without displaying an error message. This happened if there was only
    one WASTE folder in the config file, and if the files/ and info/
    hadn't been created yet.

2017-12-25

    Portuguese (pt_PT) translation added / thanks @jmrodriguesgoncalves


2017-12-20

    rmw-0.4.01 released

2017-12-15

    Polish and Nepali translations added. Thanks @suve and @ramdahal

    Nepali man page added.

2017-12-08

    Finnish translation added / thanks @sapake


2017-12-07

    The log entry from 2017-12-06 is now obsolete. If purge_after is > 0, rmw
    will only  show the message "purge has been skipped: use -f or --force"
    once a day, regardless of verbosity level. This still improves the behavior
    where that message would display every time if --force wasn't used (or if
    "force_not_required" was used in the config file).

2017-12-06

    rmw will now only show the message "purge has been skipped: use -f or
    --force" if verbose mode is on.

2017-12-02

    [#125] Implemented ncurses for --select feature.

2017-11-30

    [#126] using extra force at runtime (-ff) will now prevent messages
    such as "Directory not purged - still contains files" when purging
    directories that contain non-writable subdirectories.


2017-11-29

    new feature for testing added
      setting the RMWTRASH environmental variable to "fake-year" will write
      the year 1999 to the DeletionDate string in the .trashinfo file.

      Ex: `RMWTRASH=fake-year rmw some.txt temp.asc files.doc`

      Then run rmw with the purge option: `rmw -fg`

2017-11-26

    Martijn de Boer tested rmw on his MacOSX system today. To get a complete build,
    the only thing he needed was an additional line: '#include <locale.h>`.
    I've updated a couple spots on the rmw repo and wiki to indicate the rmw is
    a "Linux and MacOS utility".

2017-11-22

    -t --translate option added
        After translations are added, this option will display a translation
        of a default configuration file.

    strings prepared for translation, portable object template completed

2017-11-21

    Version number changed to 0.4.00

2017-11-17

    nl (Nederlands/Dutch) man page and po file added. Thanks @sexybiggetje

2017-11-14

    [#106] `make install` now installs the following man pages to the
    appropriate directories:

    * en
    * de
    * es
    * fi
    * pl
    * pt_BR

    Thank you for the tip, @suve.

2017-10-25

    [#68] File sizes now display when using '--select'

2017-10-15

    Man pages added!
    * Languages: EN, DE, FI, ES, PT, PL

    At this time, only the EN man page is installed. I don't know the
    proper way to install man pages in other languages.

2016-10-02

    Restore(): no longer takes type *char[] as an argument, only *char,
    which makes for much easier maintenance of code. Affected a few
    other functions as well (see diff if really curious).

2016-10-01

    Renamed mkinfo() to create_trashinfo()

2016-09-26

    No longer using var: waste_dirs_total & protected_dir_total.
        NULL is assigned as the last WASTE folder, so loops check for NULL
        to see when it's time to quit.

    undo_file (lastrmw) is now removed after -u is used (#58)

2016-09-25

    -p, --pause option removed

    -o, --orphaned option added
        create trashinfo files if no corresponding trashinfo is found (#16)

2016-09-18

    Issue #40 - To empty the trash, preface rmw on the command line
    with 'RMWTRASH=empty'. Example:
    RMWTRASH=empty rmw ....

    Fixed: #44 - Segfault if rmwrc isn't present in SYSCONFDIR

    Fixed: #45 - Restore fails if parent directory of target doesn't exist

2016-09-17

    enhancement: restoring files with only the basename #14

    url_escaping: #20 - escape Path key with URL (encoding) (Patched
    by Bruce Hernandez)
        Formerly this issue was about %20's not being converted to spaces.
    Bruce's patch makes things compliant with the freedesktop.org Trash
    specification:
    https://specifications.freedesktop.org/trash-spec/trashspec-latest.html


2016-09-16

    Fixed #27 - no info file found when restoring symlinks


2016-09-15

	Closed  #41 - add config option: force_not_required
	"force_not_required" in config file means -f or --force will not be
	required on the command line for purge to run.

    Completed - using removable media #12

2016-09-14

	Closed #33 - Requiring -f / --force as an option for purge to
	actually delete files (patched by Parth Suresh and Andy Alt)


2016-09-11

	Closed #30 - disable verbose mode by default (patched by Parth Suresh)
	Closed #29 - last entries in undofile get erased (patched by Bruce Hernandez)


2016-09-09

	Makefile.am : Thanks to parthsuresh - added 4 lines (#28) that will
	hopefully fix issue #21

	Added a function: open_err() : called if there is an error opening
	a file, displays a message.

2016-09-08

	Added a function: close_file(), so I don't have to worry about
	changing the way error messages are displayed.

2016-09-04

	* Issuing another release, due to issue #24

2016-09-03

	* Fixed: Warning about missing automake 1.14 #21

	* restore_rmw.c: I changed a lot of variable names, re-worked the
	function a little, and did a bit of cleaning.

	* Issuing an early release due to issue #21

-- Aug. 30 --

When building, rmw will now use the config.h that's generated by ./configure.

Added make_dir(), which creates directories when parents don't exist;
used it in several areas for code-cleanup (#18) and added related error
checking (#13).

Removed 2 functions: waste_check() and mkdirErr().

Added THANKS file.

-- Aug. 28 --

Added -std=gnu99 -Wall to the Makefile, cleaned up some warnings

Renamed purgeD() to is_time_to_purge()
Added some error checking to that function

Cleaned up get_config_data a little
Fixed the warning: /functions/config_rmw.c:252:7: warning: ‘cfgPtr’ may be used
 uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
   if (fclose (cfgPtr) == EOF)

Development documentation updated


-- Aug. 24, 2016 --

Adding more error checks

Adding more comments

More (minor) code optimization

-- Aug. 23, 2016 --

Files below protected directories are now protected (not thoroughly tested yet)

I deleted 3 functions and moved their contents to main():
*remove_to_waste()
*pre_rmw_check()
*isProtected()

WASTE directories and the rmw data/config dir is protected by default;
no need to add a separate PROTECT entry to the rmw config file

'function_prototypes.h' renamed to 'primary_funcs.c'

-- Aug. 22, 2016 --

Fine-tuning the error-checking.
https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/issues/13


-- Aug. 20, 2016 --

Added a bunch of error checking, mostly for things that rarely go wrong;
but now if they go wrong, the user (or me) will get to see an error number.

There is still a lot more error-checking that can be added.


-- Aug. 17, 2016 --

Documentation (README) updated and expanded, info added to --help option
(There is no 'man' page yet.

Fixed -B bug (https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/issues/9)

-- Aug. 16, 2016

Added a lot more error-checking to rmdir_recursive() (basically I re-wrote
most of the function).

The most annoying problem I've had with rmw over the last few years is
if there are non-writeable files in a directory that is getting purged.
I'd always get the message "unknown error while removing..." Now it's more
specific.

RMDIR_MAX_DEPTH now used. rmdir_recursive() won't go deeper than the
number set in the header file (normally set to 32)

PROTECT= option implemented, but hasn't gone through very much testing yet.
It seems to have a problem if rmw is started with
'HOME=. rmw'. The problem is that the correct realpath isn't returned, so
a match is never made, and therefore protection is ignored.


-- Aug. 11, 2016

Issue #5 implemented
https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/issues/5

Added some pointers, dispatched more globals


-- August 09, 2016

Trying to simplify things, I removed the --add-waste (a) option. I don't
think it adds much to ease-of-use and isn't worth maintaining the code.

-- August 08, 2016

rmw will now create the $HOME/.config dir if it doesn't exist (dev).

-- August 07, 2016

I've gotten rid of more global variables

the w_X paths are now in a structure


-- August 06, 2016 --

The potential mangling of the trash directory string when using "$HOME"
in the config file is now fixed!
https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/issues/2

Release issued.

-- August 05, 2016 --

Release issued.


-- August 04, 2016 --

The trash directory string issues seems to be fixed. I'm not sure why. I
moved some global variables into main() - maybe that helped. ;)

I moved some functions into the main() part of the code.

-- August 02, 2016 --

Addressed issues with how the code had been split, updated Makefile to reflect changes


June 12, 2013

Purge will no longer run if -z or -s option is
given at runtime.
