=== rmw ChangeLog ===

2016-09-18

    Fixed: #44 - Segfault if rmwrc isn't present in SYSCONFDIR

2016-09-17

    enhancement: restoring files with only the basename #14

    url_escaping: #20 - escape Path key with URL (encoding) (Patched
    by Bruce Hernandez)
        Formerly this issue was about %20's not being converted to spaces.
    Bruce's patch makes things compliant with the freedesktop.org Trash
    specification:
    https://specifications.freedesktop.org/trash-spec/trashspec-latest.html


2016-09-16

    Fixed #27 - no info file found when restoring symlinks


2016-09-15

	Closed  #41 - add config option: force_not_required
	"force_not_required" in config file means -f or --force will not be
	required on the command line for purge to run.

    Completed - using removable media #12

2016-09-14

	Closed #33 - Requiring -f / --force as an option for purge to
	actually delete files (patched by Parth Suresh and Andy Alt)


2016-09-11

	Closed #30 - disable verbose mode by default (patched by Parth Suresh)
	Closed #29 - last entries in undofile get erased (patched by Bruce Hernandez)


2016-09-09

	Makefile.am : Thanks to parthsuresh - added 4 lines (#28) that will
	hopefully fix issue #21

	Added a function: open_err() : called if there is an error opening
	a file, displays a message.

2016-09-08

	Added a function: close_file(), so I don't have to worry about
	changing the way error messages are displayed.

2016-09-04

	* Issuing another release, due to issue #24

2016-09-03

	* Fixed: Warning about missing automake 1.14 #21

	* restore_rmw.c: I changed a lot of variable names, re-worked the
	function a little, and did a bit of cleaning.

	* Issuing an early release due to issue #21

-- Aug. 30 --

When building, rmw will now use the config.h that's generated by ./configure.

Added make_dir(), which creates directories when parents don't exist;
used it in several areas for code-cleanup (#18) and added related error
checking (#13).

Removed 2 functions: waste_check() and mkdirErr().

Added THANKS file.

-- Aug. 28 --

Added -std=gnu99 -Wall to the Makefile, cleaned up some warnings

Renamed purgeD() to is_time_to_purge()
Added some error checking to that function

Cleaned up get_config_data a little
Fixed the warning: /functions/config_rmw.c:252:7: warning: ‘cfgPtr’ may be used
 uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
   if (fclose (cfgPtr) == EOF)

Development documentation updated


-- Aug. 24, 2016 --

Adding more error checks

Adding more comments

More (minor) code optimization

-- Aug. 23, 2016 --

Files below protected directories are now protected (not thoroughly tested yet)

I deleted 3 functions and moved their contents to main():
*remove_to_waste()
*pre_rmw_check()
*isProtected()

WASTE directories and the rmw data/config dir is protected by default;
no need to add a separate PROTECT entry to the rmw config file

'function_prototypes.h' renamed to 'primary_funcs.c'

-- Aug. 22, 2016 --

Fine-tuning the error-checking.
https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/issues/13


-- Aug. 20, 2016 --

Added a bunch of error checking, mostly for things that rarely go wrong;
but now if they go wrong, the user (or me) will get to see an error number.

There is still a lot more error-checking that can be added.


-- Aug. 17, 2016 --

Documentation (README) updated and expanded, info added to --help option
(There is no 'man' page yet.

Fixed -B bug (https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/issues/9)

-- Aug. 16, 2016

Added a lot more error-checking to rmdir_recursive() (basically I re-wrote
most of the function).

The most annoying problem I've had with rmw over the last few years is
if there are non-writeable files in a directory that is getting purged.
I'd always get the message "unknown error while removing..." Now it's more
specific.

RMDIR_MAX_DEPTH now used. rmdir_recursive() won't go deeper than the
number set in the header file (normally set to 32)

PROTECT= option implemented, but hasn't gone through very much testing yet.
It seems to have a problem if rmw is started with
'HOME=. rmw'. The problem is that the correct realpath isn't returned, so
a match is never made, and therefore protection is ignored.


-- Aug. 11, 2016

Issue #5 implemented
https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/issues/5

Added some pointers, dispatched more globals


-- August 09, 2016

Trying to simplify things, I removed the --add-waste (a) option. I don't
think it adds much to ease-of-use and isn't worth maintaining the code.

-- August 08, 2016

rmw will now create the $HOME/.config dir if it doesn't exist (dev).

-- August 07, 2016

I've gotten rid of more global variables

the w_X paths are now in a structure


-- August 06, 2016 --

The potential mangling of the trash directory string when using "$HOME"
in the config file is now fixed!
https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/issues/2

Release issued.

-- August 05, 2016 --

Release issued.


-- August 04, 2016 --

The trash directory string issues seems to be fixed. I'm not sure why. I
moved some global variables into main() - maybe that helped. ;)

I moved some functions into the main() part of the code.

-- August 02, 2016 --

Addressed issues with how the code had been split, updated Makefile to reflect changes


June 12, 2013

Purge will no longer run if -z or -s option is
given at runtime.
