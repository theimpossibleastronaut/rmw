rmw (ReMove to Waste) is a safe-remove
utility for the command line. Its goal is to
conform to the FreeDesktop.org Trash
specification and therefore be compatible
with KDE, GNOME, XFCE, and others. Desktop
integration is optional however, and by
default, rmw will only use a waste folder
separated from your desktop trash. One of its
unique features is the ability to purge files
from your Waste/Trash directories after x
number of days.
