Description: Safe-remove utility for the command line
 rmw (ReMove to Waste) is a safe-remove utility for the command line. It
 can move and restore files to and from directories specified in a
 configuration file, and can also be integrated with your regular
 desktop trash folder (if your desktop environment uses the
 FreeDesktop.org Trash specification). One of the unique features of rmw
 is the ability to purge items from your waste (or trash) directories
 after x number of days.
