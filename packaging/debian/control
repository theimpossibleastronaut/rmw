Description: Trashcan/recycle bin utility for the command line
 rmw (ReMove to Waste) is a trashcan/recycle bin utility for the command line.
 It can move and restore files to and from directories specified in a
 configuration file, and can also be integrated with your regular desktop
 trash folder (if your desktop environment uses the FreeDesktop.org Trash
 specification). One of the unique features of rmw is the ability to purge
 items from your waste (or trash) directories after x number of days.
