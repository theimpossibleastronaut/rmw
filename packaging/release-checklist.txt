## canfigger.wrap

Make sure the revision points to the last release, or to a revision where
sanitize is disabled

For later Debian package creation, check standards version

Copy ChangeLog entries that apply to current release to ReleaseNotes
(remove dates and reorder entries in in order of important or interest)


Add release date to ChangeLog
Ex:
2021-04-25

  * rmw v0.7.07 released


Change Month and Year in man/rmw.1

Generate html version of the manual:
  `roff2html rmw.1  > rmw_man.html` (mv the output to the website directory)

cd ..

commit changes (NOTE: meson dist only packages *committed* changes)
meson dist --include-subprojects

Remove packaging directory from the resulting xz file
  (The process is now in the GitHub workflow)

Make the AppImage

  To pass the test on https://github.com/AppImage/appimage.github.io, the
  image must be built on an older system, such as Ubuntu focal (see
  https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/discussions/1254). I do that in a
  docker image. (The process is now in the GitHub workflow)

Check copyright date/year
  packaging/debian/copyright
  packaging/Slackbuild/rmw/rmw.Slackbuild

Make Debian package
  cd packaging
  tar xf rmw-<version>.tar.gz
  cd rmw-<version>
  cp -a <rmwsrcdir>/packaging/debian .
  dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -tc (The resulting package will be one level up)

  Check the Debian package
    lintian -i -I --show-overrides rmw_0.7.07_amd64.changes

push all changes

Get the sha256sum of the source tarball, AppImage, and Debian package

Publish the release
  paste in the ReleaseNotes file and the 'sums of the two files listed above.
