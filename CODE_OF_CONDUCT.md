# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our
project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Not being disrespectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
(i.e., keep your mouth shut if you can only think of something negative
and useless to say).

* Accept or ignore constructive criticism. The choice is yours. But
don't attack someone who has given you a respectful opinion of your
code or doc changes.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal, political, or religious attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may
be reported by contacting the project maintainer, [Andy
Alt](https://github.com/andy5995) at andy400-dev@yahoo.com. He will
review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that
he deems appropriate to the circumstances. He is obligated to maintain
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further
details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Ultimately, Mr. Alt is not an expert at communication or interpersonal
relationships, and there is a chance he will not handle conflicts as
well as other people might. Additionally, he can not be held
responsible for the actions of other participants within the rmw
project, but only do his best to address problems as stated above.

Furthermore, if you feel that the project maintainer has violated the
Code of Conduct and don't feel comfortable contacting him about it,
please [report him to
GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/reporting-abuse-or-spam).
